##  My AI Usage

**AI Tools Used:** Claude AI (Anthropic)

**How I Used AI:**
1. Initial project structure and boilerplate generation
2. Test case development following TDD principles
3. Debugging authentication middleware
4. Optimizing MongoDB queries
5. React component structure suggestions

**Reflection:**
AI significantly accelerated the development process, particularly in:
- Writing comprehensive test cases
- Implementing best practices for security
- Creating consistent code patterns

However, I maintained full control over:
- Architecture decisions
- Business logic implementation
- Code review and refactoring
- Understanding every line of code
